Goodbye every one, I have done my homework so I may not update this project any more, but you're free to download any source code and executable files. I have uploaded all the files I have. I hope some day I could improve its gameplay and transplant it to the Android platform. And I hope some people could help me to improve the quality of this project.
Thank you all and hope you enjoy my work.

Brief:

It's a 3D Tetris game!(Keyboard-Control and Kinect-Control both available), and it's one of my school homework.

I use OpenGL(glut) as graphical interface and OpenNI for Kinect APIs.

As it is only a homework-level project, I'm not gonna garantee a fantastic game experience.

Because I'm not sure if I had put all the necessary DLLs in the fold, for those of you who wanna play it, download the source code and compile it in your own OpenGL(glut)/OpenNI dev-environment pleazzzzz~ Of course you can try run it through .exe file in /debug folder directly, if it bumps "missing dll files" please let me know.

FYI, here's the keyboard-control-keys: Left/Right Arrow to move boxes, A to rotate boxes, Space to rotate camera, and Down Arrow to drop the boxes directly to the bottom.

And here's the Kinect-controls: When the game starts, do a Popeye's gesture and wait for hint sound, then stand still for at least 5s util the hint sound. After that the game officially begins, move only one of your legs to control the move of boxes, do not move both of your legs because you may not return to your original position. Move left/right/forward/backward can move-left/move-right/rotate-camera/rotate-boxes, put your hands on your chest and the quickly waving to your back can drop the boxes directly to the bottom.
